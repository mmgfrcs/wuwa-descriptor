## How Did This Website Came to Be

One of the pet peeves of mine for this game (and Genshin Impact as well) is the skill descriptions. It is perhaps the worst at describing what the skill *actually* does, which is *exactly* its function. Now, I do know that skills can be complicated - enough that you can [write a wiki page about it](https://keqingmains.com/raiden/), and the descriptions aren't even *complete* - which it shouldn't be or it would just drag on.

However, more often than not, the descriptions in both games can be streamlined. The reason why it isn't can sometimes be boiled down to 2 reasons.

### Character Identity

One of the somewhat widely-agreed upon reasons was that simple descriptions can kill character identity. There are actually 2 approaches of this argument. One of which seems to come from players of tabletop games, which are used to this description:

> Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
>
> The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice...
>
> -- Wish, one of D&D 5e's Spells

Notice that the first paragraph doesn't say anything about what this spell does. In tabletop games, this is actually important: some tabletop games are played with "Theater of the Mind" - essentially imagination, where you need to picture it in your head to understand, and the first paragraph helps with that. This is carried over to this game:

> As Encore loses control, Cosmos breaks free and wreaks havoc on its surroundings.
>
> Basic Attack: Cosmos: Frolicking
> 
> During Cosmos Rave, the Basic Attack is replaced with Cosmos: Frolicking, which performs up to 4 consecutive attacks, dealing Fusion DMG, considered as Basic Attack damage...
>
> -- Encore's Resonance Liberation

As you can see, the first paragraph *also* doesn't say anything about what this skill does.

But we're playing *video games*. We have zero need to *imagine*. Character identity do not get lost just because - in Encore's description above - the description do not mention that Encore "loses control".

I call these "fluff text"
